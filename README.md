# ProjectPlanet


This has two small projects :

***ProjectOne***
A web GUI : Main function is to convert a data structure into an HTML table. I created a web page for a (kind of) wimbledon championship which has some tabs such as About, Player Details Table, Schedule, Contact. Each tab can be opened to view the respective data. The table is displayed in "Player Details Table" tab. I did this using HTML,Javascript.
 
Files included : a)home.html : The home page. 
		  b)scripts folder : contains js scripts.
		  c)styles : contains css.

TO RUN : Open the home.html file and the home page of the app will load. Then open "Player Details Table" tab to see the data. (Make sure you have 			the scripts & styles folders accessible)

***ProjectTwo***
A Perl script to display a SQLite table : I have a table in SQLite with 3 columns and 8 rows. I wrote a Perl script to display this table's data. 

Files included : a)SQLite script.txt : Contains table creation and insertion statements.
		 b)PerlScript.pl : Contains the script to display the table's data. 

TO RUN : Run the SQLite script in SQLite(after creating a database). Then import the PerlScript.pl to Padre(this is what I used) and run it. You will see the data in cmd.
